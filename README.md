# Chest-X-rat-Abnormality-Detection

Chest X-ray abnormality detection is a medical image analysis task that involves automatically identifying and localizing abnormalities in chest X-ray images. Chest X-rays are a common diagnostic tool used by medical professionals to diagnose a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and lung cancer.

The goal of chest X-ray abnormality detection is to develop computer algorithms that can accurately detect and classify abnormalities in chest X-ray images, such as nodules, masses, infiltrates, and pleural effusions. These algorithms can be used to assist radiologists in diagnosing and treating patients more quickly and accurately.

Recent advances in machine learning and deep learning have led to significant progress in chest X-ray abnormality detection. Several deep learning models have been developed that can achieve state-of-the-art performance on large-scale chest X-ray datasets, often surpassing the accuracy of human radiologists. These models have the potential to improve the speed and accuracy of medical diagnoses, particularly in resource-constrained settings where access to radiologists may be limited.
